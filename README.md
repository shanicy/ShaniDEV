This is a solution to WSC Sports PartB test.
It uses Consumer Producer Design Pattern where the connections between the modules made by a queue (RabbitMQ) and DB (Relational - SQL Server)
Things I have'nt finished:
1. Add a Dependency Injection mechanisem (using Unity, or a straight-forward approach) where a third party service or db is used.
2. The exception handling is not completed
3. Logging 
4. I used console applications for easy debugging. Projects like "ProducerConsole" Should be in a Windows service.
